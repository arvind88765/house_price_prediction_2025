# House Price Prediction 2025

This project is a **house price prediction web application** built with **Flask** and powered by machine learning. It uses a trained model to predict house prices based on various factors like location, area, availability, and other features. The app provides an easy-to-use web interface where users can input house details and get a price prediction in real-time.

## What is this project?

The **House Price Prediction 2025** application leverages **machine learning** techniques, specifically a regression model, to predict the price of a house. The model is built using data from various sources and is deployed in a web application using **Flask**.

Key features:
- **Predict house prices** based on input features like area, location, and availability.
- Built with **Flask** for easy deployment as a web service.
- Uses **XGBoost** (or other ML models) to generate predictions.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you’ll need the following:
- **Python 3.x** (Recommended version: Python 3.9+)
- **Required Python packages**:
  - Flask
  - XGBoost
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy

You can install the required packages by running the following command in your project folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use
Clone the repository
Start by cloning the project to your local machine:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/arvind88765/house_price_prediction_2025.git
Navigate to the project folder
Go into the project directory where the files are located:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd house_price_prediction_2025
Install dependencies
Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run the Flask app
To start the Flask web server and access the prediction app, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Access the app
Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to:
arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000
This will bring up the app’s main interface where you can input house details (like size, location, and availability) to get price predictions.

How to Run via Command Prompt (CMD)
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
Navigate to the project directory where app.py is located:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd path\to\house_price_prediction_2025
Activate your Python environment (if using a virtual environment):

For Windows:
bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open your browser and go to:
arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000
You should now be able to use the web interface to get price predictions!

Troubleshooting
If you see warnings like the XGBoost version compatibility warning, it’s not an error. This warning informs you that the model might have been saved with a previous version of XGBoost, but it won’t affect the functionality.

Flask development server warning: This message is normal when running Flask in development mode. For production, you should use a proper WSGI server (like Gunicorn or uWSGI).
